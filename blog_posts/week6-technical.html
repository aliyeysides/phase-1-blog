	<h1>Classes and Modules</h1>
	<p>Classes and Modules go hand-in-hand and are a big part of the Ruby language. Classes are basically a Ruby construct that allows us to implement properties and inherit those properties by its instantiated objects. Read more about Ruby classes <a href="http://aliyeysides.github.io/blog_posts/week5-technical.html">here</a>. Another great use of classes in Ruby support the idea that the property of one class can be shared with another class using inheritance. However, sometimes we want to have two classes that are able to inherit from each other, not just one from a parent class. This is where modules come in. Modules are a collection of methods that a class can add to it’s collection using the include keyword followed by the module name.</p>

	<p>I recently encountered the need for modules during this week’s solo challenge for DBC. The idea was to create a playlist that had two classes: song and playlist. The challenge’s tests were requiring a pass on a song#play method but also a playlist#play_all method. I wanted to use the play method I built for the song class for each song in the playlist, after all--every playlist is composed of more than one song. However, I had defined the play method for the song class and I could not call that method on an object that hadn’t been instantiated by the song class. So here’s what I did:</p>

	<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
	class Song
		def initialize(song, artist)
			@song = song
			@artist = artist
		end

		def play
			p "Now playing #{@song} by #{@artist}..."
		end
	end

	class Playlist < Song # Here I use the < to say Class#Song is the parent of Class#Playlist
		def initialize(*song)
			@playlist = [*song]
		end

		def add(*song)
			@playlist.push(*song)
		end

		def remove(*song)
			@playlist.delete(*song) 
		end

		def includes?(song)
			@playlist.include?(song)
		end

		def play_all
			@playlist.each {|x| x.play}
		end

		def num_of_tracks
			@playlist.count
		end
	end
	</pre>

	<p>Notice how I used the "<" when naming the Playlist class to signify that all playlist objects are songs, hence, all playlists can use the Song class methods. But, there’s another way using modules and it's a much more flexible:</p>

	<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
	module Music
	
		def play
			p "Now playing #{@song} by #{@artist}..."
		end
	end


	class Song
	include Music

		def initialize(song, artist)
			@song = song
			@artist = artist
		end
	end

	class Playlist
	include Music

		def initialize(*song)
			@playlist = [*song]
		end

		def add(*song)
			@playlist.push(*song)
		end

		def remove(*song)
			@playlist.delete(*song) 
		end

		def includes?(song)
			@playlist.include?(song)
		end

		def play_all
			@playlist.each {|x| x.play}
		end

		def num_of_tracks
			@playlist.count
		end
	end
	</pre>

	<p>By creating a module called Music, I was able to define any number of methods I wanted to include as a part of another class that called on it with include. Now both Song and Playlist objects have the ability to call on the method #play.</p>
