	<h1>Classes and Modules</h1>
	<p>Classes and Modules go hand-in-hand and are a big part of the Ruby language. Classes are basically a Ruby construct that allows us to implement properties and inherit those properties by its instantiated objects. Read more about Ruby classes here: 123242335235. Another great use of classes in Ruby support the idea that the property of one class can be shared with another class using inheritance. However, sometimes we want to have two classes that are able to inherit from each other, not just one from a parent class. This is where modules come in. Modules are a collection of methods that a class can add to it’s collection using the include keyword followed by the module name.</p>

	<p>I recently encountered the need for modules during this week’s solo challenge for DBC. The idea was to create a playlist that had two classes: song and playlist. The challenge’s tests were requiring a pass on a song#play method but also a playlist#play_all method. I wanted to use the play method I built for the song class for each song in the playlist, after all--every playlist is composed of more than one song. However, I had defined the play method for the song class and I could not call that method on an object that hadn’t been instantiated by the song class. So here’s what I did:</p>

	<pre class="prettyprint">
		class Song
	def initialize(song, artist)
		@song = song
		@artist = artist
	end

	def play
		p "Now playing #{@song} by #{@artist}..."
	end
	end

	class Playlist < Song
	def initialize(*song)
		@playlist = [*song]
	end

	def add(*song)
		@playlist.push(*song)
	end

	def remove(*song)
		@playlist.delete(*song) 
	end

	def includes?(song)
		@playlist.include?(song)
	end

	def play_all
		@playlist.each {|x| x.play}
	end

	def num_of_tracks
		@playlist.count
	end
	end
	</pre>

	<p>But, there’s another way using modules:</p>
