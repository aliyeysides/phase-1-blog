	<h1>My Thinking Style and Learning</h1>
	<p>Research done at the University of Connecticut by professor Anthony Gregorc has suggested that we not only have a preferred learning and working style, but also have more of an inclination toward a type of thinking. He has divided these four boxes of thinking as <strong>Concrete Sequential, </strong><strong>Concrete Random, </strong><strong>Abstract Random, </strong>and <strong>Abstract Sequential. </strong>According to <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">this test</a> I'm a Concrete Random thinker.<br>
	<br>
	So what does being a Concrete Random thinker constitute? Well according to Anthony Gregorc, this is the preferred type of thought for those who enjoy experimenting. Concrete thinking is the quality that enables us to register information directly through our five senses, in contrast with Abstract thinking, which allows us to visualize what is not there. This is what is known as our perceptual quality. Random refers to our ordering ability which allows us to organize information by chunks, and in no particular order, unlike Sequential ordering which allows our mind to organize information in a linear, step-by-step manner.<br>

	DBC is beginning to become one of the most challenging experiences of my life. With that said, it would be wise to understand the way we learn with anything we decide to take on. In August of 2010, I opened my first business. It was a little store that served as a hybrid retail/service business model, and no one knew what to expect, myself included. I knew nothing about running a brick and mortar business let alone the product I was selling, but just having the desire to learn was all I needed. I made mistake on mistake and I knew how to accept feedback and correct myself. The customers picked up on this and even though there was something they didn't like about the business, they knew if they voiced their opinion it would not go unheard. You should have seen my first menu, it looked like something out of the crabby patty. But, I fixed it. Then I noticed more mistakes, and I fixed those as well. I tried different models, different pricing, different promotions, different marketing, and most failed, but at the end of the day I learned what worked. This is the same way I'm going to approach DBC. I'm going to try different things, in different ways, and see what sticks. The biggest struggle for me with implementing this has been the intensity that DBC demands. I've learned more in a week at DBC's prep phases than I have on my own in months.<br>

	I think it's important to note that all abilities and qualities are present in cognition, however, I do agree that I may be more of a Concrete Random learner. I really enjoy learning by experimenting to find answers to see what works and what doesn't. I'm ok with taking the risk that something might not work out. If I know what doesn't work, well that's just another piece of the puzzle that helps me form the rest of the picture. There's a really great Benjamin Franklin quote that has resonated with me about learning, “Tell me and I forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I learn.” Concrete Random learners rely on their intuition which contributes to the risk, but being able to solve those problems independently is when we learn best.
