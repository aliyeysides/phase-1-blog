	<h1>My Thinking Style and Learning</h1>
	<p>Research done at the University of Connecticut by professor Anthony Gregorc has suggested that we not only have a preferred learning and working style, but also have more of an inclination toward a type of thinking. He has divided these four boxes of thinking as <strong>Concrete Sequential, </strong><strong>Concrete Random, </strong><strong>Abstract Random, </strong>and <strong>Abstract Sequential. </strong>According to <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">this test</a> I'm a Concrete Random thinker.<br>
	<br>
	So what does being a Concrete Random thinker constitute? Well according to Anthony Gregorc, this is the preferred type of thought for those who enjoy experimenting. Concrete thinking is the quality that enables us to register information directly through our five senses, in contrast with Abstract thinking, which allows us to visualize what is not there. This is what is known as our perceptual quality. Random refers to our ordering ability which allows us to organize information by chunks, and in no particular order, unlike Sequential ordering which allows our mind to organize information in a linear, step-by-step manner.<br>
	<br>
	I think it's important to note that all abilities and qualities are present in cognition, however, I do agree that I may be more of a Concrete Random learner. I really enjoy learning by experimenting to find answers to see what works and what doesn't. I'm ok with taking that risk that something might not work out. If I know what doesn't work, well that's just another piece of the puzzle that helps me form the rest of the picture. There's a really great Benjamin Franklin quote that has resonated with me about learning, “Tell me and I forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I learn.”
