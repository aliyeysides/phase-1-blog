	<h1>Issues in Tech: Net Neutrality</h1>
	<p>The Net Neutrality issue in this country is something that most people don't know about which is alarming considering it directly effects every business, software application, and user of the internet which would include just about everyone. There is an ongoing struggle between the internet service providers and proponents of net neutrality, and that battle is being fought over whether there should be a leveled playing field for all users to access the same bandwith speed at the same rate across the board. This means the same bandwith speeds and rate a giant company like Netflix uses would be accessible to any startup or anyone for that matter from the comfort of their homes. The net neutrality principle is the idea that promotes this leveled playing field and is in constant danger of being revoked and here's why you should give a damn.</p>
	<p>Internet Service Providers see an incredible opportunity to create a tiered system in which internet speeds are dispersed like lanes. There are fast lanes and there are slow lanes. Internet service providers like Comcast are hoping that large companies that use a lot of bandwith like Netflix pay more for it, but also make up for this divergence by taking away the high speeds you were used to, unless of course you pay way more than you do now. This directly contradicts the paradigm of the internet which is to promote equality of everything, including use. The main issue with this is it that it allows companies that already have a majority of an online segment to go unattested, without any competition. Think about any startup trying to compete with the likes of tech giants when they have to foot a massive bill before they can even prove themselves, and when they do, guess what, their costs go skyrocketing before they could perhaps monetize their site. This tiered system would be grave for technology innovation in this country.</p>
	<p>Tom Wheeler was the lobbyist for companies like Comcast and Verizon for years before president Obama appointed him to become the new head of the FCC. Why is this important? Well, imagine the big bad wolf being chosen to become the new carpenter that's going to fix the little piggies' homes. The one person that fought to destroy net neutrality for years has now been appointed as the person that's going to decide the fate of net neutrality.</p>
	<p>This is a serious issue and I urge you to do more research and reach out to your congressmen or reach out to the FCC to voice your concerns. Below are some more resources:</p>
