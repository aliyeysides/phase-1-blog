	<h1>Test Driven Development</h1>
	<p>Imagine you are building a plane, how would you know it can fly? Well, you test it. But if I’m building something as elaborate and expensive as a plane, I would be putting loads of time and resources into building something just to see it crash and burn. There has to be a way to test it before and during the building process so that we know our efforts are not wasted into creating a failure. This is where Test-Driven-Development comes into play. TDD is a method of software development that relies on tests being written before any actual programming is done. Some languages even include their own testing frameworks, like rspec for Ruby. But by writing specific tests for all foreseeable cases, we can see how it will fail and where.</p>

	<p>The true greatness of TDD is in that it allows for a strong foundation for future code development, especially when introducing new features or just refactoring. The tests you write from the start will notify you if any changes made will break something.</p>

	<p>Debugging also relies heavily on test driven development. By replicating the issue with tests, we can make changes accordingly until the desired conditions are met.</p>

	<p>Some drawbacks of test driven development include missing cases. If I can’t write tests that account for each and every possible outcome, then our code is sure to break somewhere and catch us by surprise. Another issue is creating false positives. I could write a test that spits out true but doesn’t accurately reflect what our code is performing. This also brings up the necessity of making tests more than just boolean, or results of true and false. The trick is to write tests that let you know exactly what passed and tell you what didn’t pass if not. This way we can pinpoint issues and troubleshoot much more efficiently.</p>

	<p>So, back to our example. I’m building plane and I put something together and try to fly it. Imagine the plane telling you; “Hey, I won’t fly because I don't have wings.” Well, of course our next move would be to add wings. So, we test it again. But it doesn’t fly. “Hey, I won’t fly because I don’t have an engine.” So, we add the engine. And this goes on and on until the all tests pass and the plane flys. Taking this approach really does make for some efficiently designed code and makes our job as developers much simpler.</p>


	<p>Here is an example of a boiler plate test that I use in ruby pretty frequently:</p>

	<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
	def assert(actual, expected, message)
		if actual == expected
			puts message
		else 
			raise “Assertion Failed on #{message}”
		end
	end

	assert( foo , bar  , “flight test”)
	</pre>
