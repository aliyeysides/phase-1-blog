	<h1>Imposter Syndrome</h1>
	<p>I am an imposter. I am a faker. I manage people to think of me in a certain way. I am a manipulator. Someone is going to eventually find me out. I do not belong here.</p>

	<p>These are the things that go through the head of someone suffering from Imposter Syndrome, and has riddled my mind for years. For as long as I can remember, my ‘accomplishments’ have been nothing but luck, ordained by fate, and out of my control. I’ve been at the right place at the right time and my ‘intelligence’ has played little to no role in it.</p>

	<p>When I opened my first retail store at the age of 19, I had no idea what I was doing, and I frequently point to this as the cause of any success I had from it. I had recently dropped out of college and needed to do something to compensate this failure. It is because I did not know my own ignorance that I was able to put myself into a position that I really do believe anyone could have achieved similar, if not better results. I can not tell you how many times I thought; “Do people really see this as a legitimate business? I’m only 19, how are people going to take me seriously? Will someone see this as a joke and walk out?” I was so afraid that someone would see through the facade I built and see me for what I really was, a naive child. So, at the age of 21, I sold the business and never looked back. People’s reaction to when I tell them this story always seems to be one of enchantment, but as I get older and tell people, the general bemusement dwindles. This only confirms my thoughts that they too believe it was not much of an impressive achievement, and it becomes difficult for me to internalize my own intelligence.</p>

	<p>Now, at Dev Bootcamp I feel the same way. I feel like I’m in a room full of people that really know what’s going on and I don’t. I feel like my answers are boilerplate, non-creative approaches to the solution. I feel like once we really start to dig into the material I’m going to be left in the dust. And now with this in mind, it puts an even further weight on my shoulders to get by. ‘Get by’ seems to be the motive. Get by without someone noticing that I don’t belong here. Get by and continue the lie that I know something someone else doesn’t.</p>

	<p>We live in an environment that will scold you for every non-conventional step you take, but then worship you if those actions bring success. What changed? Was that person always smart? Did they grow to become smarter? Or was it absolute luck? I try not to be so hard on myself but until I can prove that it was because of my own intelligence, creativity, or effort that made my goals possible, that I can relax and let my guard down. Even then, will I really credit any success that comes my way to be my own, or was it because I pretended to not be myself?</p>

	<p>My name is Ali Yeysides and I am a recovering imposter.</p>
