	<h1>Websites to always keep up in your browser:</h1>
	<p><strong><a href="https://imgur.com">Imgur.com</a></strong></p>
	
	<p>Imgur is one of my favorite sites because it gets right to the point. The design is so simple that the user experience is ever hardly unintuitive, with pictures layed out in grid form on the homepage, it's rare to to miss any good content because it's right infront of you from the start. No searching required, althought you could if you wanted to, you just go on and explore. Visually, I'd describe imgur in these 5 adjectives: Simple, Organized, Intuitive, Precise, and most importantely Fun. It's definitely a site you can leave open in your browser and continue to explore all day whenever you need a good laugh.</p>

	<p><strong><a href="https://youtube.com">Youtube.com</a></strong></p>
	
	<p>Youtube is another great example of a site that intices your desires to explore it. Search, like it's parent company Google, is the main prioprietary aspect of Youtube's experience. The design is light, crisp, yet never lacks features you'd want it to have. The uses are also extremely versitile. Whether you need a good laugh or want to hear someone's great advice and tips. or you need a sports or news update, Youtube is the ultime destination, and is another tab I always keep open.</p>
	<p><strong><a href="https://tunebow.com">Tunebow.com</a></strong></p>
	
	<p>Tunebow is my favorite online radio. The reason? All you have to do is go on and hit play. That's it! No stopping what you're doing just to pick another track. Tunebow's creators handpick each song that seemlessly intertwine to make an endless and soothing playlist. It's a great way to discover new music. Tunebow's playlist is only outdone by it's beautiful layout. Again the common theme of simplicity rules. Amazing backgrounds rule the space of this site, and change frequently. It's one thing to put out great music, but to complete the experience with these asthethicly pleasing visuals makes this another great site to keep up at all times.</p>
