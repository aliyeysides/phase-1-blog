	<p>Q: Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened?</p>

	<p>A: Some of my most emotional conflicts I’ve had have been with my family members. They’ve usually been quarrels over petty shit, nothing big, which kind of makes the whole argument even worse to be in. One day in particular when I was moving out I got into a heated fight with my Mom who was doing nothing but helping me pack. When I say ‘heated fight’ I really mean me being overly dramatic and stressed out, and unloading my anger out on her. Definitely the west side of the compass of shame, and that’s exactly what I felt after I left on an egregious note, shame.</p>

	<p>Q: What was the source of the conflict?</p>

	<p>A: Me. The source was me not being able to control my anger.</p>

	<p>Q: Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?</p>

	<p>A: My actions made me physically ill afterward. I had to drive 3 hours after the fight and it was the worst way to depart from home.</p>

	<p>Q: If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</p>

	<p>A: I should have detected myself becoming more anxious during the move and diffused any situation I saw myself getting angry.</p>

	<p>Q:What did you learn from this experience?</p>

	<p>A: We speak turkish at my house. I came to the states when I was 4 years old and any turkish conversation I’ve had with my family is really repetitive, so I never really get a chance to expand my vocabulary. The most turkish I’ve learned to-date was from watching turkish tv when I was younger. My dad’s english is ok and my mom‘s is almost non-existent. This creates a lot of issues at home. To begin with there’s a lot of miscommunication and when a discussion gets heated, not knowing how to express yourself gets infuriating. From this specific experience I learned to take your time and breathe before lashing out at anyone else. Especially your family.</p>
