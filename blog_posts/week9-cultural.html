	<p>One of the first times I’ve posted a question on the google+ community was for a sublime error I was receiving which held me back from getting any work done. I posted the exact error message and even searched google for the same error but to no avail. Usually stackoverflow has tons of questions already asked by others with multiple answers to each question. But, in this case the question was asked with no answers and only a few explanations of why it may have been happening. The only response I received from google+ was from an instructor linking to that stackoverflow page saying there were no resolutions. At first, I was really pissed. I mean, I couldn’t do any of the assignments until I had sublime working, and no one was being useful.</p>

    <p>Finally, I decided to take things into my own hands and mess around with it myself. I read the explanations of why it may be happening and thought if I could upgrade sublime to the newest version that it may somehow patch the issue. To my surprise, I was correct! I posted my working solution to the stackoverflow page where the question was initially asked and it worked for others as well. This was an amazing feeling.</p>

    <p>I’ve definitely learned that although I may have asked the right question, the answer is not always there until you really dig for it. Sometimes this can be more rewarding. Since I solved the problem, other stackoverflow users asked me follow up questions about this specific issue as if I knew something they didn’t. It simply comes down to breaking things down. My initial frustration with the instructor that couldn’t help me was totally pointless. Plus, it wasn’t his job just to give me the answer, it was my job to ask him where I wanted to be led.</p>

    <p>Programming really does come easy when you know what to ask google. As long as you know what you want to do, the how doesn’t matter.</p>

    <p>Here’s the link to the specific issue I was dealing with and my working answer below:<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23165426/sublime-text-on-ubuntu-14-04-keeps-attempting-to-remove-it/25126312#25126312">sublime-text-on-ubuntu-14-04-keeps-attempting-to-remove-it</p>
