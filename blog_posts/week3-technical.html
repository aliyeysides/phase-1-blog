	<h1>Why is JavaScript popular in web development? What are the great things about JavaScript? What are its limitations?</h1>
	<p>JavaScript, also known as ECMAScript, was originally developed by Brendan Eich of Netscape under the name Mocha, later LiveScript, and finally renamed to JavaScript in 1995. In March 1996, Netscape Navigator 2.0 was released, featuring support for JavaScript for the first time, showcasing what this new langauge can do. At the time, most scripting was done on the server side and there were limited web related client-side scripting languages.<br>
	<br>
	So, what's all hooplah about Javascript? Well, for starters it's pretty easy to learn. For anyone with previous experience with any object-oriented languages, it could probably be picked up in a few days. Before learning Javascript, the only object-oriented language I knew was Ruby, yet the syntax was close enough that I felt comfortable using Javascript in a matter of a week, although this took lots of practice. The reason for this is the never ending support online. If you ever run into trouble with Javascript there is a huge open source community to help you out and give you immediate feedback. Most of the time I just searched something only to find it had already been asked and answered multiple times. Javascript is also very fast in that it performs client side requests which reduces the load time on the server. Above all, it is supported by every browser even, hold on to your pantaloons ladies and gentleman, IE. That's right, javascript works with the most egregious browser of them all. 
	<br>
	Some have pointed out the limitations of the language in that, unlike other object-oriented languages, JS has no classes. There are however ways around these inheritance issues, but that's for another post. No programming language is perfect, although Ruby is close imho, JS suffers from certain syntax issues that might trip the novice learner. For example, semicolons. Semicolons must follow every expression, and one single omission will leave you scratching your head for hours. The one issue that really gets me is the lack of human readability with the language. For example, some users of Javascript will iterate over each element with the for loop in this manner: for (i=0;i<arr.length;i++). In languages like Ruby, there are native methods built in that does all this
	and comes off as much more legible by the reader, which could save a lot of time and headache.
