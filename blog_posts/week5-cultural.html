	<h1>Pairing & Giving Feedback</h1>
	<p>At Dev Bootcamp, there is a considerable amount of importance placed on giving feedback to one another alongside a pairing program that becomes a mirror used to reflect your performance throughout the course. The feedback that students give to one another must be considerate and useful in that they must be actionable, specific, and also kind. This is what we call A.S.K. The pairing sessions also provide numerous benefits. One reason is that by pairing, we mimic the workplace and prepare ourselves for the careers that await us in this industry.</p>

	<p>When I first paired with a fellow DBC member I didn’t know what to expect. I felt anxious for several reasons. Will they be smarter than me? Will I be able to contribute anything? Will a look stupid if I don’t? But, that in effect is the beauty of these pairing sessions. I’m forced to prepare and always keep up with my work, otherwise I feel vulnerable or even worse, left behind. This way you’d get to gauge your performance with others that are working on the same challenges and you can really compare your comfort of the material.</p>

	<p>Sometimes, your pair will know much more than you for many inevitable reasons, but, there are still takeaways by pairing with them. I’ve learned many practical tricks from my pairs over the past several weeks that have helped improve the quality of my code and has saved me a lot of time. Other times you may know more than your pair, which is also good because when they ask you questions you get to solidify your understanding of the concept.</p>

	<p>After your pairing session, you submit a piece of anonymous feedback for your pair that they’ll get to see at the end of the unit. As long as it follows the A.S.K guidelines, you get a list of feedback from various pairs that highlight the session from their point of view. What you do with this information is totally up to you, but more often than not the advice is a benchmark on your performance with others that should be taken very seriously. After all, how good is a programmer that can’t work with others?</p>
