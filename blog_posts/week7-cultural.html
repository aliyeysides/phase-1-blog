	<h1>My Values</h1>
	<p>Ambition, Close relationships, Confidence, Introspection, Justice, and Patience. These are the values that make a great entrepreneur. In fact, these are the values that can make anyone successful. However, it’s just not enough to hold true to these values, one must have a burning passion for them. One must champion these values and try to instill these principles in others and actually feel a desire to see them spread amongst the community.</p>

	<p>Every year, Neshaminy High school’s business department grants me the honor to come into their classrooms and speak about my past business ventures and experiences. These are the same classes and hallways I once walked through, but this time it’s my turn to teach.</p>

	<p>Of all these values one is ultimately true for every scenario or situation you may find yourself in. Patience. Patience is a powerful tool. One of my favorite quotes about patience comes from Sun Tzu’s The Art of War; “He who is prudent and lies in wait for an enemy who is not, will be victorious.”</p>

	<p>And it’s true. If you can wait for the perfect moment, you have already fought half the battle. All other values come second to patience. There is no justice without patience. There cannot be successful ambition without patience. With relationships, your patience is truly tested. People are naturally afraid of wasting time or some opportunity they think will never come again, but understand that life is long, and your time is only valuable when it is curated correctly.</p>
