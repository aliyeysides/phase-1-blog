	<div id="title">About Ali Yeysides</div>
	<p>My name is Ali Yeysides and I was born in Adana, Turkey March 17th 1991. Growing up, I always liked breaking things down and trying to figure how stuff worked. The first thing I've ever programmed was for a video game called Counter Strike (Yea, I'm one of those #pcmasterrace guys :P). At the time, there were several sites for indie developers that allowed people to collaborate on custom skins, and for people that don't know what a skin is, it's like a different look to the same item in the game. So I created custom gloves and just up it out there. Pretty soon, I had 300 downloads which was a big deal for a stupid 15 year old. Looking back, it kinda looked like shit. But my point being that someone perhaps hundreds of miles away used what I built from my bedroom and a computer.

    To me, programming is the ultimate artistic expression. It fills the need I have to be an artist, to create something, and to interact with people on a larger scale. </p>
