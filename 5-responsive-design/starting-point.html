      <p>This was a great pairing session for me as it underlined the competencies I've learned this week and last with CSS and positioning. I really started off confused with this topic but doing it over and over again with practices like this and building our own site has helped me get familiar with the concepts. I still find myself looking online searching for help but some things have become more or less just trial and error for me. I think the biggest part is getting the site to become responsive as soon as possible so that you can continue working on the site without worrying too much about elements colliding. I really wish I had more time this week though because unfortunetly I had to skip a lot of the resources that I wanted to go over, especially with this exercise. Thankfully my pair and I got through this challenege fairly quickly, and that's more to do with our abilities to hone in on the issue and fix it directly. We immediately understood that the cat images in this case were what was causing the site to have a horizontal scroll, so we tackled that and any margin issues right off the bat. Overall this was a good challenge and I feel more comfortable with CSS.</p>
